/**
 * Represents a DFU Operation - the act of updating the firmware on a
 * nRF device.
 *
 * A firmware update is composed of one or more updates - e.g. bootloader then application,
 * or softdevice then application, or bootloader+softdevice then application, or only
 * one of these pieces.
 *
 * A nRF device is represented by the transport used to update it - the DfuOperation does
 * not care if that device is connected through USB and has serial number 12345678, or if that
 * device is connected through Bluetooth Low Energy and has Bluetooth address AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF.
 *
 * The transport must be instantiated prior to instantiating the DFU operation. This includes
 * doing things such as service discovery, buttonless BLE DFU initialization, or claiming
 * a USB interface of a USB device.
